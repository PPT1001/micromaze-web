                <br/>MicroMaze is an inter-university competition designed to challenge participants in developing a micro mouse capable of solving a maze within a specified timeframe. The main challenge is to design a micro mouse capable of solving a maze within a specified time frame.<br/><br/>Â 
This competition tests students' skills in robotics, programming, and problem-solving as they create robots that navigate from the start to the end of the maze efficiently and accurately.<br/><br/>
This provides a platform for undergraduates to apply their knowledge in a practical setting, fostering collaboration and learning.<br/><br/>
